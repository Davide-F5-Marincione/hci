\begin{enumerate}
    \item Yes. Metro, bus, train, and tram.
    \item The user chooses mostly the metro because it is faster and there are fewer stopovers.
    \item Overcrowded, delays, cancellations.
    \item Moovit, Google Maps, Probus. The user uses them both to find the right path and timetables.
    \item Enough trusting. Not totally because sometimes the path is not actually the shortest and some existing paths are not even considered.
    \item Not particularly worried. If a classification is needed, he/she is more worried about sharing the mic and camera information.
    \item Not worried.
    \item He/She would not trust a community because people are not always sincere. Would like to participate in case of actual collaboration.
    \item He/ She would be incentivized by an honor system, in particular, if it would involve the unlocking of new contents in the application.
    \item Not interested in profile customization.
